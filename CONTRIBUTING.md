# Contributing to HCL CDP Web SDK React

Thank you for contributing to the HCL CDP Web SDK React wrapper! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Commit Message Format

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. This is **required** for automatic versioning and changelog generation via Release Please.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature (triggers **minor** version bump: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
- **fix**: A bug fix (triggers **patch** version bump: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi colons, etc)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **build**: Build system or dependency changes
- **ci**: CI/CD configuration changes
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

### Breaking Changes

To indicate a breaking change (triggers **major** version bump: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0):

1. Add `!` after the type: `feat!: remove deprecated API`
2. Or include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

   ```
   feat: change config interface

   BREAKING CHANGE: The config interface has been restructured
   ```

### Examples

#### Good Examples ✅

```bash
feat: add useSessionEnd hook
fix: resolve Next.js server component serialization issue
docs: update README with hook examples
feat(hooks): add session lifecycle management
fix(provider)!: change context API structure
refactor: simplify CDP wrapper logic
perf: optimize re-renders in provider
test: add hook testing suite
```

#### Bad Examples ❌

```bash
Added new hook              # Missing type
Fix bug                     # Missing colon and proper format
feat(hooks) Fix issue       # Missing colon
FEAT: new hook              # Type should be lowercase
feat: Added new hook.       # Subject ends with period
```

### Scope (Optional)

The scope is optional and provides additional context:

- `feat(hooks): add useSessionEnd`
- `fix(provider): correct context initialization`
- `docs(readme): update hook documentation`

### Subject

- Use imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- Don't capitalize first letter
- No period (.) at the end
- Maximum 100 characters for the entire header

### Body (Optional)

- Explain **what** and **why**, not **how**
- Wrap at 72 characters per line
- Separate from subject with a blank line

### Footer (Optional)

- Reference issues: `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456`
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: description`

## Development Workflow

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will automatically set up husky for commit message validation.

### 2. Make Your Changes

Create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
```

### 3. Commit Your Changes

The commit message will be automatically validated by commitlint:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

If your commit message doesn't follow the format, the commit will be rejected with an error message.

### 4. Create a Pull Request

When you create a PR, the GitHub Action will validate all commit messages in the PR. If any commits don't follow the format, the PR checks will fail and you'll receive guidance on how to fix them.

### Fixing Commit Messages

If you need to fix commit messages:

```bash
# For the last commit
git commit --amend

# For multiple commits (interactive rebase)
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Last 3 commits

# Force push to update PR
git push --force
```

## Automated Release Process

Once your PR is merged:

1. **Release Please** automatically creates/updates a release PR
2. The release PR includes:
   - Updated version number (based on commit types)
   - Generated CHANGELOG.md
   - Updated package.json
3. When the release PR is merged:
   - A GitHub release is created
   - The package is automatically published to npm
